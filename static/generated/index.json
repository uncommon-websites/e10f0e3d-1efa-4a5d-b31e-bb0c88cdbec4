    "prompt": "A sophisticated private art advisory room with two experts quietly discussing over a partially visible artwork, surrounded by books and archival boxes. Warm natural daylight streams through large windows, casting soft shadows and highlighting the focused expressions and subtle gestures of the advisers. Intimate, editorial-style composition with mid-range framing, rich blacks in clothing, Gallery Stone walls, and subtle hints of Signal Blue in textiles or decor. The environment exudes quiet authority, with quality natural materials and a calm, contemplative mood.",
